# MeterPwrShell
Automated Tool That Generate A Powershell Oneliner That Can Create Meterpreter Shell On Metasploit,Bypass AMSI,Bypass Firewall,Bypass UAC,And Bypass Any AVs.

# Notes
- NEVER UPLOAD THE PAYLOAD THAT GENERATED BY THIS PROGRAM TO ANY ONLINE SCANNER
- NEVER USE THIS PROGRAM FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSE
- SPREADING THE PAYLOAD THAT GENERATED BY THIS PROGRAM IS NOT COOL
- ANY DAMAGE GENERATED BY THIS PROGRAM IS NOT MY (As the program maker) RESPONSIBILTY!!!
- If you have some feature recommendation,post that on Issue
- If you have some issue with the program,try redownloading it again (trust me),cause sometimes i edit the release and fix it without telling ðŸ˜‚
- If you want to know how tf my payload bypass any AVs,you can check on [this](https://gist.github.com/GetRektBoy724/9383c9580cb1c9935fc04cc7eb7ef004) and [this](https://blog.sevagas.com/Bypass-Antivirus-Dynamic-Analysis)
- Dont even try to fork this repository,you'll dont get the releases!
- From version v1.6.0,the raw source code is published on the repo.
# Features (v1.5.1)

--------------------------------------------------------------
## Advantages Of MeterPwrShell Compared To The web_delivery Module From Metasploit Framework
- Shorter stager (Or short one-liner in this case)
- Various AMSI bypass technique and code
- Dont need to setup a server for the stager 
- Support Ngrok built-in (so the victim doesnt need to be on the same local network)
- Automatic Built-in Privesc
- Easily Bypass Windows Defender
